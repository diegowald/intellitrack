Hi Carlos, thanks for the message and the update on your progress.  I hope
the RFID piece comes together for you.

Yes the price of $475 is good for you, providing you send in the completed
dealer agreement.  We want you to be our dealer and are looking forward to
business with you that is good for both parties.

Our lead time on the GX modems is getting better and we would hope to send
them out fairly soon after we get your order.  We can discuss payments and I
wait for your call and try to answer your questions.

See attached a few examples of the $PRAVE sentence.   If your programmers
have some problems John Sonnenberg here can help.  The technical manual has
details on the sentence format, see section 16.4

Thanks and may you have great fortune! – Larry.
